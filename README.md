## Planning & Design

### A Website for K-pop Band SEVENTEEN
When choosing the musician, I considered the following aspects:

- Including specific informations and photos about the band
- Incorporating the musician's iconic color and logo
- Ensuring easy access to external articles to reference
- Dedicated page for tour information

### Using Bootstrap
As the main requirement was using Bootstrap, I aimed to leverage it as much as possible. Although this might not be the most efficiant way to build a website, I wanted to explore the capabilities of Bootstrap. 

### Unigue Design Identity
Since this is a musician website, I wanted to give it a distinctive identity. I incorporated the band's logo and iconic color which are Rosequartz `#F2DDDE` and Serenity `#89ABE3`.
