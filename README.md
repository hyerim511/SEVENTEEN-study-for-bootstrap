## Planning & Design

### A Website for K-pop band SEVENTEEN
To choose the musician, I considered these things:
- Have many specific informations and photos
- Iconic color and logo
- Easy to find outlink articles to use
- Tour information for a special page

### For Bootstrap
The main requirement was using Bootstrap, so I wanted to use Bootstrap as much I can. This would not be efficiant way to build a website, but I wanted to discover that how many things I can to with Bootstrap. 

### Identified Design
This is the musician website, so I wanted to design it has there identity. I used there logo and iconic color which is Rosequartz `#F2DDDE` and Serenity `#89ABE3`.
